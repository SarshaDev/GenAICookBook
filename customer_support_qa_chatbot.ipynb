The buzzword is everywhere and people are wondering what is NFT and what is its use? Well, there is not really a one-line explainer. And that’s why we have brought a comprehensive explainer on NFT, what is its use in digital art, and more. So without wasting any time, let’s go ahead and learn about NFTs (Non-fungible Token) in complete detail.\\n\\nWhat is NFT: A Definitive Explainer (2021)\\n\\nHere, we have mentioned all the questions that people have in their minds regarding NFT.

We have explained NFTs, and tell you how you can buy, make and sell your own NFTs easily.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Before anything, let me give you a clear-headed definition of NFT and what it stands for. NFT stands for Non-fungible Token. Fungible by its very definition means something that is mutually interchangeable. For example, you can exchange a $10 note with another $10 note or exchange it with two $5 notes. In both cases, the value remains the same and you will have no problem exchanging the money. Here, money is a fungible item as it can be exchanged without diminishing the value.\\n\\nSo when we say Non-fungible, it means something that can’t be exchanged with a similar item of similar value. To give you a simple example, if you want to replace the Mona Lisa painting kept in Louvre, Paris with another printout of the same image, will it be the same? And more importantly, will it hold the same value? The answer is no. Here, the incomparable Mona Lisa painting is a Non-fungible item that can’t be exchanged with another item having an identical appearance.'),\n",

We have explained NFTs, and tell you how you can buy, make and sell your own NFTs easily.', 'language': 'en-US'}, page_content='Uniqueness is the key here. A Non-fungible item is, therefore, something that is unique and authentic. Something that holds value for its authenticity. Now we come to the token part. A token is a 40-digit string of words and numbers that hold the information of the original artist who created the masterpiece, the current owner of the item (it can only be one), and the current price of the item. This storage of information is backed by Blockchain technology which can’t be altered by any means due to its decentralized system.\\n\\nFinally, when you put all three words together, NFT means an incorruptible token that holds ownership information about an item that is unique and authentic. NFT is basically a certificate of ownership or authenticity. This is the general definition of NFT, but if you want to get a complete idea about NFTs then you need to understand the concept with digital art as an example, which I have covered in the next section.\\n\\nWhat is the Use of NFT in Digital Art?'),\n",

Well, as I explained in the above section that NFT is a signature of authenticity and it provides that authentic stamp of approval on the web while dealing with digital arts. We all know, in today’s world anything can be tampered with and people can pass off others’ work as theirs. Basically, on the web, it’s next to impossible to find the original creator of an artwork and that’s where NFTs come into the play. NFTs pretty much aim to bring art collecting into the digital age with completely digital art that is sold as NFTs.'),\n",

Digital artists can generate NFT for their original work and auction it off to another person while maintaining the information about the original creator, the current owner, and the current value. The best part about NFT is that as many times the digital art is sold to another person, a share of the value will be transferred to the original creator. This makes NFT a great proposition to digital artists for earning money through their artwork.'),\n",

First off, the reason Ethereum has an early headstart is because they were the ones who started this project with their new NFT blockchain system called ERC-721 in 2015. Subsequent to that, Ethereum brought ERC-1155 and advanced the technology before Bitcoin and Flow could catch up.\\n\\nIn what was the first introduction of NFT to the masses, in 2017, Ethereum introduced a blockchain game called CryptoKitties. In this game, players could purchase, collect, breed, and sell virtual cats using Ether (Ethereum’s cryptocurrency). At that time, the highest-selling cat was sold at $117,712 which was mind-boggling. Getting a cue, Ethereum incorporated the NFT system into its cryptocurrency and now they are leading the market.'),\n",

Now with the current boom, it’s anyone’s guess where the market will go from here.\\n\\nThe Cons of NFT\\n\\nWhile we discussed the pros of NFT from above and beyond, there are some major cons that you should keep in mind before investing in a digital collectible through NFT. First off, it takes up an enormous amount of energy to generate and maintain the system which makes it unsustainable and makes a negative impact on the ecology. It’s because, unlike cryptocurrency, a non-fungible token runs on a proof-of-work blockchain which is less energy-efficient. As an aside, expect GPU prices to go even higher in the near future due to extreme mining.'),\n",

Experts say that paintings and rare collectibles do not hold value just because of the sheer artistry, but also because there is an established audience who want to own and collect rare paintings or an artwork that no other person has.\\n\\nExperts point out that those who are buying digital artwork are not paying huge sums because they appreciate art. Instead, they want to create a bubble to earn money by reselling it at a higher price. It’s worth noting that the digital world does not have a scarcity of artwork — unlike physical masterpieces — so the prices will likely come down once the bubble bursts.\\n\\nHow to Buy NFTs\\n\\nBuying an NFT is as simple as heading to any of the NFT marketplaces, and making a purchase.

Second, you need to see which marketplace you want to buy from, as well as the cryptocurrency required to purchase the NFT you’re interested in.

In Rarible, for example, you will have to pay a small fee to list your art. Further, you will have to pay additional money to get your art converted into an NFT, and then, once your NFT is sold, Rarible will also charge you a commission, as well as some money for transferring the cryptocurrency from the buyer’s wallet to yours.\\n\\nOverall, making a non-fungible token art is easy, but selling it involves a bit of work.

You head over to your file manager to delete the large files which you no longer require, but you have no clue which of them are occupying most of your disk space. In this article, we will show some easy methods to check disk usage in Linux from both the terminal and the GUI application.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nCheck Disk Space Using the df Command\\n\\nIn Linux, there are many commands to check disk usage, the most common being the df command. The df stands for “Disk Filesystem” in the command, which is a handy way to check the current disk usage and the available disk space in Linux.

To view the disk usage for individual files and directories, use the du command. Here, du stands for “disk usage“.

In the second part of the syntax, the -r flag is used to sort in reverse order and the -n flag is used to sort files based on the numeric value.

You head over to your file manager to delete the large files which you no longer require, but you have no clue which of them are occupying most of your disk space. In this article, we will show some easy methods to check disk usage in Linux from both the terminal and the GUI application.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nCheck Disk Space Using the df Command\\n\\nIn Linux, there are many commands to check disk usage, the most common being the df command. The df stands for “Disk Filesystem” in the command, which is a handy way to check the current disk usage and the available disk space in Linux. The syntax for the df command in Linux is as follows:\\n\\nCheck Disk Usage Using GUI\\n\\nThe command line output for various disk usage commands can be hard for some people to understand. So there are some GUI alternatives that make the task of monitoring disk usage easy. Some common GUI tools to monitor disk usage are the GDU Disk Usage Analyzer and the Gnome Disks Tool,which can be easily installed using the following command:\\n\\nInstalling disk usage analyzer:\\n\\nsudo snap install gdu-disk-usage-analyzer\\n\\nInstalling disk-utility tool:\\n\\nsudo apt-get -y install gnome-disk-utility\\n\\nCheck Disk Usage Using Gnome Disk Tool\\n\\nThe Gnome disk utility tool is generally used to format storage partitions to a specific type. In the default view, all the storage partitions are shown.\\n\\nTo know details about a partition such as the device name, file system type, available space, and more, you need to click on the partition’s name. The disk utility tool is a useful tool, but you can lose all your important data if used carelessly.\\n\\nCheck Disk Usage Using Disk Usage Analyzer Tool\\n\\nMonitoring disk usage is much easier in GUI using the Disk Usage Analyzer Tool as compared to CLI. After installing this tool, access it via the Applications menu and then follow the steps below:\\n\\n1. When you first open the Disk Usage Analyzer tool, it will show all the storage partitions connected to your system along with your Home directory.\\n\\n2. To know about the disk usage of any device, click on the device name. It will scan the entire device and display a ring chart of the disk occupancy for all the folders. When you hover over any portion of the graph, you will see which folders are occupying the most disk space.\\n\\nCleanup Disk using Disk Usage Analyzer\\n\\nAfter analyzing different locations of the file system, you might want to delete some of the storage hogging files. The Disk Usage Analyzer Tool also doubles up as a cleanup tool for the files or folders you want to delete. To delete any files or folders:\\n\\nTo display the sizes in human readable format like in megabytes, gigabytes, etc. instead of bytes, use the -h flag via the command syntax below:\\n\\ndu -h\\n\\nDisplay Disk Usage for a Particular Directory\\n\\nThe du command shows the disk usage for all folders. But you can view the disk usage for a specific folder, using the -s flag with the basic command as under:\\n\\ndu -s -h <directory_name>\\n\\nCompare Disk Usage of Two Directories\\n\\nWith the du command, you can also compare the disk usage of two or more directories as shown below:\\n\\ndu <options> <directory_1> <directory_2>\\n\\nClean Disk Space Using the Command Line\\n\\nYou can use either of the du and the df commands in combination with other Linux commands to list out the files and directories occupying the most space. Then, you can choose to keep those files or delete files in Linux to free up storage space on your computer.\\n\\nSorting Files based on File Size']"
